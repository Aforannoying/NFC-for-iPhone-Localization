# NFC-for-iPhone-Localization

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-for-iphone/id1249686798

This is a public repo for the NFC for iPhone localization.
Here you can help to translate the app in a language that I don't speak. 

Some guidelines for adding translations:

- Fork the repo and start translating in a text editor of your choice.
- For a new language please add a new folder with the appropriate language code. The codes can be found here https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp
- Do not add or remove any new lines or comments. Keep the line numbers as they are.
- Do not modify any translation keywords. Only modify the translation (e.g. "translation_keyword" = "Translation here"; )
- Make a pull request when you are done translating.
- I really appreciate your help. I'll give out promo codes for NFC for iPhone and maybe other future projects I'm working on. You can count on that ;)

Thank you!
